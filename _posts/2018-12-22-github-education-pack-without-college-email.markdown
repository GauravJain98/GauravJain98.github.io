GitHub is a website that uses Git version control.

There are multiple profits but my main usage is for private repositories, needed for making projects code bases that cannot be public or you start learning something that you don’t want to share with the world.

But it has one problem

But it’s just $7/month and if you are a student or just started out its a lot of overhead. That’s why Github has a student developer pack!.

Select Accordingly<br>

Get a picture of an academic document with the date preferred as recent as possible.<br>

You saw my rejected application that was me using my ID card dated 2016 for my application on 2017.

So i used my examination admit card. Use any academic document that has a recent date.
